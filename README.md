# Hello! I'm Nez💖
### Ambitious Compuer Engineering student from Turkiye
I'm a 22-year-old senior Computer Engineering student at Gazi University, specializing in AI/ML, focusing on NLP, Computer Vision, and object detection. As a TÜBİTAK fellow, I conduct NLP research and develop VQA models for radiology images while also building computer vision models for UUV systems in global competitions. I enjoy sharing research on Medium & Kaggle in Turkish 🇹🇷. Beyond AI, I'm a licensed chess player ♟️ and an athletics runner 🏃‍♂️.
